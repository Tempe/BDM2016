To load data with cleaner run command in terminal:
- "bash loadData.sh" because we can't make files executable.
- "meta.json" name of file on http://130.226.142.195/bigdata/project2/
- "DummyCleaner" Java class file to execute.
- Will print to StdOut

```
bash loadData.sh meta.json DummyCleaner > meta-output.txt
```
